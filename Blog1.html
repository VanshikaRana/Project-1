<h1>Written Test Tips</h1>
As the first part of the Campus Placement Process, a number of companies conduct written tests in order to know the knowledge level of candidates. Written tests are conducted to eliminate 
the candidates that do not match the requirements of the company. As we have seen across numerous campuses in the country, the number of job seekers is generally greater than the number of 
openings in various companies and this is leading to use these tests as a method of eliminating students.</br><br>
<h1>Written test consist of three areas:</h1>
 <h4><b>Aptitude Tests:</b></h4>
Aptitude Tests are designed to test a candidate on a specific set of skills like analytical and decision -making skills. They ask basic mathematical questions, which show your way of approach to 
complex situations.
<h4> <b>Technical Tests </b></h4>
If you are applying for a non-programming job (Core job) then you will have questions on particular areas of your specialization such as electronics, mechanical and civil etc. If you are applying for
 software jobs the questions will be on basics of programming languages to test your programming skills.
<h4> Psychometric tests</h4>
Companies are conducting Psychometric tests to assess your ability in specific skills (eg, verbal, numerical and diagrammatical reasoning) or to find out about your personal qualities by using
 personality questions. The only thing you have to follow is answering honestly.
<h1>Few tips to crack written test:</h1>
You should concentrate on both aptitude and Technical knowledge to crack the written exam.
Go through the question paper first and mark answers to questions which do not require any calculation. Then attempt those which require a little work and finally those which seem difficult.
Do not attempt the difficult ones at the beginning and if you are not getting answers, let go of it and move on to next question.
If it is an online test, the same principle applies if you can go back and forth the test. If not, you have no other option but to attempt the questions as they appear on the screen.</i>
